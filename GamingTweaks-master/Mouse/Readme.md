### Mouse
* Change your [mouse polling rate](https://www.howtogeek.com/182702/mouse-dpi-and-polling-rates-explained-do-they-matter-for-gaming/) down from 1000hz to 250hz/120hz (sometimes it does redude the mouse lag for some games). Keep in mind that this tweak is _optional_ because in most of the cases 1000hz works just fine (depending on the used mouse driver). 
* Take your [mouse sensitivity from another game](https://www.mouse-sensitivity.com/), see if it helps you but at the end you must decide if you like it or not. 
* There is no 'pro aim' tweak, just give yourself time to progress. Play hard go pro - yep it's true!
